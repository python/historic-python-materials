World Simulation Framework</font></b>
<br><i>by Jason Asbahr</i>
<p>This paper presents a global survey of current work on a commercial
system, the Beyond Simulation Framework.  Research and development
of world simulation control code for real-time 3D environments is described. 
General approach, motivations, architecture, benefits, and the lessons learned 
are described, as well as future direction for work in this area.  The emphasis 
is that the dynamic scripting approach described here has merit applied to the 
construction of entertainment and educational virtual environments.

</font></b>
<br><i>by John Aycock</i>
<br>Department of Computer Science, University of Victoria, B.C., Canada 
<p>The optimization of a Python program has a limit point, beyond which a programmer 
must resort to C code in order to get more speed. Not all programmers are willing or 
able to take this step. 211 is an experimental program which automatically converts 
Python virtual machine code into C. In this paper I discuss 211, its results, and 
suggest changes to Python's internals which should yield better results and faster
programs.

Python</font></b>
<br><i>by John Aycock</i>
<br>Department of Computer Science, University of Victoria, B.C., Canada 
<p>"Little languages" such as configuration files or HTML documents are
commonplace in computing. This paper divides the work of implementing a
little language into four parts, and presents a framework which can be
used to easily conquer the implementation of each. The pieces of the framework
have the unusual property that they may be extended through normal object-oriented
means, allowing features to be added to a little language simply by subclassing
parts of its compiler.

Extensions in C++</font></b>
<br><i>by Paul F. Dubois</i>
<br>Computer Science Project Leader, X-Division
<br>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
<p>Python extensions are usually created by writing the glue that connects
Python to the desired new functionality in the C language. While simple
extensions do not require much effort, to do the job correctly with full
error checking is tedious and prone to errors in reference counting and
to memory leaks, especially when errors occur. The resulting program is
difficult to read and maintain. By designing suitable C++ classes to wrap
the Python C API, we are able to produce extensions that are correct and
which clean up after themselves correctly when errors occur. This facility
also integrates the C++ and Python exception facilities.

</p><p>This paper briefly describes our package for this purpose, named CXX.
The emphasis is on our design choices and the way these contribute to the
construction of accurate Python extensions. We also briefly relate the
way CXX's facilities for sequence classes allow use of C++'s Standard Template
Library (STL) algorithms on C++ sequences.

<br><i>by F. Oliver Gathmann</i>
<br>University of Toronto, Surface and Groundwater Ecology Research Group
<p>This paper summarizes experiences made with using Python for implementing
an interactive environment for Discrete Event Simulation of patchy animal
populations. The main novel features of the system are runtime assembly
of the simulation object sources allowing for easy integration of user-defined
code, flexible monitoring of the simulation process using fast numerical
arrays of variable dimensionality (based on the Numerical Python extension),
and realtime multivariate analysis of the simulation results.&nbsp;

Mathematics with Python</font></b>
<br><i>by Ivan Van Laningham</i>
<br>Callware Technologies, Inc.
<p>The Mayan calendar is well suited to computer calculation, but existing
programs are not extensible and are generally written in compiled languages, 
which limits their portability.  Python is portable, extensible, and has built-in 
features that make processing dates in the Mayan calendarcreasonably straightforward. 
A basic introduction to the Mayan calendar is presented, followed by discussion
of some of the problems encountered using conventional languages, and some 
alternative approaches using Python are given. The areas of computerized parsing 
and special class methods in Python are covered. A discussion of recovering
dates from partial inscriptions follows, with highlights of a CGI program to allow 
users to enter such partial dates and receive a list of possible solutions. Future 
directions for Mayan calendrical research with Python are suggested. The conclusion 
suggests that archaeologists and epigraphers in the field could use Python to
help them pin down otherwise indeterminate dates in the Mayan inscriptions.

<br>Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin
<p>Virtual tables are a mechanism to find methods of a class efficiently.
Typically, they are used for statically-typed languages. This paper discusses
an implementation of this mechanism for Python. Different design choices are 
analyzed, and performance measurements are presented.

<br>Reliable Software Technologies
</i><p><i>The core role of email in explosive growth of the Internet and of new
communities within it calls for ailing List Management Systems (MLMS) which
can adapt to, and even foster, new forms of community organization as they
emerge. A new MLMS, Mailman, is well suited to such evolution because it
has been developed to be versatile and extensible. One factor contributing
to these strengths is its implementation in Python. In this paper we will
look at various aspects of Mailman&#8217;s extensibility. We will consider how
the system&#8217;s design and how features of its implementation language, Python,
factor into that extensibility.

<td><a name="masse"></a><b><font size="+1">Evolutionary Prototyping:&nbsp;
"Add Later" Static Types for Python</font></b>
<br><i>by Roger E. Masse</i>
<br>CNRI
<p>This paper is concerned with the benefits of prototyping as a method of 
evolving software and clarifying requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Python type 
system, properties of type systems, and the aspects of &#8220;scripting&#8221; languages 
that lend themselves to rapid application development are reviewed, specifically 
dynamic typing.  The benefits of static typing in &#8220;systems&#8221; programming languages 
and how end-products written in these languages can benefit from additional compile 
time checks, enhanced readability, and more efficient machine execution are also 
presented.  Following an assertion that the Python language is well suited to 
prototyping tasks, an &#8220;add later&#8221; static type syntax for Python is introduced. 
This optional language feature would allow mature programs to acquire more 
conspicuous, well-understood type definitions and expand Python&#8217;s capabilities 
towards suitability as a &#8220;systems&#8221; language implementation.

<td><a name="mcgrath"></a><b><font size="+1">A Python Based Production
System for High Volume Electronic Publishing</font></b>
<br><i>by Sean Mc Grath</i>
<br>Digitome Electronic Publishing
<p>The Official Record of the Proceedings of the Irish Parliament is a
document collection spanning 76 years, 600 volumes and some 125 feet of shelf space. 
The project described in this paper involved capturing these volumes electronically 
in XML (eXtensible Markup Language)[1] and automatic conversion to a CD-ROM/Internet 
publishing product known as Folio Views.  Folio Views[2] is a commercial text 
database/search and retrieval tool that is particularly popular in the government/
legal/financial publishing sectors.  It has a full text search engine that is 
powerful and fast&#8212;par-ticularly for large document collections. A single Folio 
Views publication (known as an Infobase) can be up to 4 GB in size.  To get data 
into Folio Views it must be converted to a tagged text format called Folio Flat File
(FFF). FFF can be created directly from word processing docu-ments but it can also be 
generated from databases and structured text formats such as XML as discussed in this 
paper.  All the software aspects of the electronic publishing process&#8212;from data
capture quality assurance through to the final generation of a &gt;2 GB Folio Views 
Info-base&#8212;are written in Python. This paper provides a brief overview of XML and 
illustrates how and why Python was used to build this production system. It presents
an overview of a Python toolkit for XML processing known as LumberJack de-veloped by 
the authors[3].  It includes details of some of the techniques used to integrate Python
programs as first class "documents" in the overall document hierarchy of the project. 
It also presents details of how Py-thon was used as a powerful document validation and 
reporting tool.

<td><a name="montanaro"></a><b><font size="+1">A Peephole Optimizer for Python</font></b>
<br><i>by Skip Montanaro</i>
<br>Automatrix, Inc.
<p>This paper describes the implementation of a peep-hole optimizer for Python byte 
codes. Python's byte code compiler currently generates code that can easily be improved.
The peephole optimizer implemented presented here implements a number of common optimizations,
including jump chaining, constant expression evaluation and elimination of unnecessary loads. 
Some optimizations rely on specific properties of Python or its virtual machine. Some 
optimizations common to statically typed languages, such as algebraic simplication and 
expression rearrangement, are prevented by Python's dynamic typing.  Preliminary results 
obtained using pybench[Lemb] suggest that the optimizer has a positive benefit for specific 
operations. With the current measurement tools available however, it is difficult to quantify 
benefits that can be derived by using the optimizer. Situations in which the benchmarks may 
not yield reliable results are considered. The limitations Python places on the optimizer are 
discussed, especially restrictions caused by the dynamic nature of the language. Other 
performance improvements to the Python interpreter are discussed brie y.

to C Extension Modules</font></b>
<br><i>by Jonathan Riehl</i>
<br>United Space Alliance
<p>PyFront is a system for the conversion of Python modules into C extension
modules. PyFront is related to the Paths static analysis tool for Python,
but employs a higher fidelity data flow model. In building these higher
fidelity models, PyFront bridges the gap between the interpreted Python
language, and the compiled C language. The C extension modules generated
by PyFront will provide faster execution times but identical results to
the original Python source. PyFront has the potential to offer an intermediate,
but automatic, step in the optimization of Python modules and routines.

<br><i>by Frank Stajano</i>
<br>Olivetti-Oracle Research Laboratory &amp;
<br>University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory 
<p>The SMS server is a system that allows mobile users to access information
on their fixed computer facilities through the short message facility of GSM 
cellphones. Writing a versatile and extensible SMS server in Python, with 
interfaces to the cellphone on one side and to the Internet on the other, 
has been an interesting and enjoyable experience. This paper examines some 
Python pro-gramming issues and techniques used in implementing the server 
and distils some experience-based insights about the relative strengths 
and weaknesses of this remarkable programming environment when compared 
to the author&#8217;s previous weapon of choice in the realm of scripting.
