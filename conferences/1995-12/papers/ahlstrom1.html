<BODY><H1>Extending C++ Classes with Python</H1><STRONG>Presented at
the December 1995 Python workshop by <A HREF="mailto:jim@interet.com">James
C. Ahlstrom</A></STRONG><P>This paper describes a way to derive Python
classes from an existing C++ class library.  These Python classes will
inherit C++ methods from parent classes and Python can call these
methods.  Python can also override C++ methods, and these can be called
by Python or by C++.  In short, we want Python to act just like C++ as
part of an existing class hierarchy.  There is more than one way to do
this.  This paper describes the method used to make Microsoft's
Foundation Class Library (MFC) available in <A HREF="http://www.python.org/workshops/1995-05/ahlstrom.html"
>WPY, a Python GUI module,</A> and the examples below are taken from
WPY. </P><H2>Inheritance</H2><P>Assume that we have a C++ class
library available, MFC for example.  We want to derive a Python class
such that the Python object inherits methods from all its parent classes
whether these are Python classes or C++ classes.  So we must describe to
Python what the C++ class hierarchy is.  A simple way is to just write
out the C++ class hierarchy as Python classes.  This is a part of the
MFC class hierarchy in Python, and a derived Python class and object:</P><PRE
># Read the MFC manual and write out the following:
class CObject:
  pass
class CCmdTarget(CObject):
  pass
class CWnd(CCmdTarget):
  pass
class CDialog(CWnd):
  def __init__(self, parent, text):  # Python WPY support.
    self.wpyChildList = []
    self.wpyText  = text
    self.wpyParent = parent
    self.wpyFlags = wpyFlagsDialog
    self.wpyDefaultButton = None

# Derive a Python class to inherit from C++ classes.
class My_Dialog(CDialog):
  pass


# Make a Python dialog object
py_dialog = My_Dialog(None, "Sample Dialog")</PRE><P>We can now start
to see how to call a C++ method.  Suppose we call the GetClientRect()
method of py_dialog.  This method is a C++ method in class CWnd.  So we
must first add it to CWnd, and then call into C++ to execute the method.
 The basic rule is that the C++ method must be defined at its correct
place in the C++ class hierarchy.  So our CWnd class now looks like
this: </P><PRE>class CWnd(CCmdTarget):
  def GetClientRect(self):
    rect = CRect()
    rect.wpyFlags = self.wpyFlags
    rect.wpyLocX, rect.wpyLocY, rect.wpySizeX, rect.wpySizeY =\
         _wpy.GetClientRect(self)
    return rect    # a CRect giving size (location is 0,0) 
		   # of client area
</PRE><P>The method GetClientRect() is a CWnd method just as it should
be.  But the  real C++ version is declared as CWnd::GetClientRect(RECT
*).  We have altered the arguments to be more Python-like.  Instead of 
altering a rectangle tuple, the Python version returns a Python
rectangle class object.  It is frequently necessary to redesign method
arguments and method return values so that they are more natural in
Python.  It is convenient to do this in the method definitions in the
Python class hierarchy.  The actual C++ method returns its rectangle as
four integers, and these are assigned to the Python CRect.  To return an
error to Python, it is often convenient to return Python "None" instead
of the usual object, although that is not done here.</P><P>We need a
C-language interface module to link the Python name to a C function. 
This is described in the <I>Extending and Embedding the Python
Interpreter</I> document which comes with Python.  In the example, the
module named "_wpy" is a C-language module defined in the file
wpy_ntmo.cpp, and it has a function which corresponds to GetClientRect
defined as follows:</P><PRE>extern "C" static PyObject *
WpyGetClientRect(PyObject *self, PyObject *args)
{
  RECT rect;
  PyObject * obj;
  if (!PyArg_Parse (args, "O", &amp;obj))
    return NULL;
  CWnd * pWnd = (CWnd *) theApp.GetCppObject(obj);
  VERIFY_WINDOW(pWnd);
  pWnd->GetClientRect(&amp;RECT);
  PyObject *pyobj = Py_BuildValue("(iiii)",
    rect.left, rect.top, rect.right, rect.bottom);
  return pyobj;
}
</PRE><P>This module simply gets its one argument (a Python object),
calls the CWnd method GetClientRect with a local RECT pointer, and
returns the four integers of the rectangle.  Since Python has great C
interfaces, it could have created the Python CRect object and returned
that itself, but that was not done here.  The only troublesome aspect of
this function is where to get a CWnd object in C++, since all that is
available is a Python object.</P><H2>Object Twins</H2><P>For the above
scheme to work, we need a C++ object which is associated with each
Python object.  When a Python object is required in a C++ method the
corresponding C++ object is used.  When C++ calls a method of an object,
the method of the corresponding Python object is called.  When C++ or
Python deletes the object, the twin object is deleted too.  It can be a
little tricky to accomplish all this.  For the above dialog example,
Python is responsible for creating the dialog object, and C++ will not
create this object on its own.  So we can use a Create() method for our
dialog class which notifies the GUI that a CDialog object should be
created.  This Python method is:</P><PRE>class CDialog(CWnd):
  def Create(self):
    # Create a modeless dialog (not used for modal)
    _wpy.CDialogCreate(self, self.wpyParent)
    return self
</PRE><P>The arguments are the ones required for the basic C++ call,
and must include the Python dialog object "self".  In C++ the
corresponding function is:</P><PRE>extern "C" static PyObject *
WpyCDialogCreate(PyObject *self, PyObject *args)
{
  PyObject *pydialog, *pywnd;
  if (!PyArg_Parse (args, "(OO)", &amp;pydialog, &amp;pywnd))
    return NULL;  // Argument is self, parent
  CWnd * window = (CWnd*)theApp.GetCppObject(pywnd);  
  // NULL return OK.
  CWpythonDialog * dialog = new CWpythonDialog();
  if (!dialog){
    ERR_CREATE
    return NULL;
  }
  theApp.RecordObjects(dialog, pydialog, TRUE);
  if (!dialog->Create(IDD_DIALOG1, window)){
    ERR_CREATE
    return NULL;
  }
  //dialog->ShowWindow(SW_SHOW);
  Py_INCREF(Py_None);
  return Py_None;
}
</PRE><P>Note that this function has created a new C++ object of class
CWpythonDialog, a C++ class derived from CDialog.  This C++ object is
the twin to the Python object.  The method RecordObjects() records these
objects as twins, method GetCppObject(PyObject) returns the C++ object
given the Python object, and method GetPythonObject(CObject) returns the
Python object given the C++ object.</P><P>We are now finished with
calling a C++ method from Python.  We first construct a Python object,
either directly from CDialog or from a class derived from CDialog, such
as My_Dialog above.  We then call its Create() method to notify the GUI
that we are creating a dialog box.  This creates a C++ dialog box which
is an instance of the CWpythonDialog class, and records the C++ object
and the Python object as twins.  We can then call the method
GetClientRect() of the Python object.  Python inheritance will locate
the method as a method of CWnd, the correct C++ method.  This method
will call into C++ using the usual C-language interface.  The interface
will look up the C++ object which corresponds to the Python object
performing the call, and the C++ method GetClientRect() will be called
for this C++ object.  The return rectangle will be returned to Python as
four integers, which will be assembled into a Python CRect object which
becomes the return value of the method call.</P><P>In general, WPY will
create a C++ object derived from an MFC class for every Python object
created, it will record the C++ and corresponding Python objects as
twins, and it will provide a way to look up the twin of either object. 
There are several ways to do this.  In the above example, the
RecordObjects() method was called to do the recording.  This is a method
of the application instance, which is convenient since there is exactly
one app instance and its object is in a global variable.  The
RecordObjects() method creates an entry in two C++ dictionaries, one for
C++ to Python, one for Python to C++.  Actually, most WPY classes call
RecordObjects() from within the C++ constructor instead of from within a
create method as in the example.  This requires that the Python object
pointer be passed to the constructor (not a problem).  The method
UnRecordCpp() is available to remove the two dictionary entries, and it
is always called within the C++ destructor.</P><P>Another altenative
which is arguably better is to record the Python object pointer as an
attribute of the C++ object.  It is then directly available, and a
dictionary is not necessary.  This is a good idea, but in WPY some
classes are used directly, so no derived class is available for the
pointer.  The dictionary is used uniformly just for consistency.  The
C++ pointer can also be  stored as a Python int ( a long) as an
attribute of the Python object, but since there is no protection against
the programmer changing this attribute, the cast back to a pointer made
me a little nervous.</P><H2>C++ Calls Python</H2><P>To complete the
picture we need to see how C++ would call a method of a Python object. 
Consider the OnOK() method of CDialog.  This method is called when the
user presses the enter key while the dialog has the focus.  It usually
dismisses the dialog and returns the same result as pressing the OK
button.  To send this event to Python, we must first create the method
in CWpythonDialog as a C++ virtual function override.  Here is the code:</P><PRE
>void CWpythonDialog::OnOK()
{
  theApp.CallPython(this, "OnEnter");
}
</PRE><P>When C++ calls this method, the method simply calls the Python
object.  First, the dictionary (or other method) returns the Python
object twin, then the attribute "OnEnter" is looked up.  If it is found,
the CallObject() function executes the Python method.  Care must be
taken to be sure that CallPython() follows Python inheritance to find
the method to call.  It is easy to provide for method arguments, for a
return value, and for what to do if the Python method does not exist.</P><H2
>Virtual Methods</H2><P>We now can now create a Python method which
overrides a C++ method by using our interface in both directions, Python
to C++ and C++ to Python.  For each virtual method create the base class
Python method which calls the C++ method, and create the C++ method
which calls the Python method.  Consider a C++ call to that method.  The
C++ function will call the Python method, and if it does not exist,
Python inheritance will return the Python base class method.  That
method will be called, and it will call back into C++.  That means that
C++ has called its own base class (through Python) just as it should. 
If the Python method does exist, it will be called.  The Python method
may or may not call the base class method as desired.</P><P>Now
consider a Python call to the Python method.  If the method does not
exist, Python inheritance will return the base class method, and the C++
method will be called.  If the Python method does exist, it will be
called, and it is still free to call the C++ base class method too. 
Note that this scheme enables Python to override any C++ methods, even
ones which are not virtual.  Of course this is because in Python all
methods are virtual.  Since I havn't found a way to prevent this, I have
decided to consider it a "feature".</P><H2>Problems</H2><P>The main
problem in this scheme is deciding who is responsible for creating
objects (C++ or Python) and maintaining the twin objects.  In the above
example, Python had to create the object (a dialog box), since dialog
boxes do not pop up unless the programmer writes one in Python.  In WPY,
two step creation is used for all objects because this is convenient for
other reasons (geometry management), so there is a Create() method.  But
that is not the point, since a create method can be called from __init__
too.  The point is that Python created the object, and if the object
goes out of scope it will be deleted and garbage collected (with the
usual exception for circular references).  Of course, we need to be sure
C++ does not try to access an object which Python has deleted.  And the
Python programmer has a right to expect that if the object does go out
of scope, the C++ object is deleted too.  To achieve this we need to
make sure that C++ never INCREF's the Python object, even though it
retains a reference to it in its dictionary, because that would prevent
Python from deleting it.  We also would need a __del__  method which
would notify the C++ system that Python has deleted the object so that
C++ could delete it too, and remove it from the dictionaries.  This is
the general case.  In the dialog box example above, these problems do
not happen because dialog boxes stay in existence until the user (or the
programmer) explicitly deletes them, so a complete cleanup can be done
then.</P><P>If C++ creates the object, we have a different situation. 
Then Python must be called to create a Python object, and INCREF must be
called to prevent Python from deleting the object until C++ is done with
it.  In WPY these synchronous create/delete events are handled  by
understanding exactly what MFC and Python are trying to do with an
object; that is, you have to know what you are doing.  Luckily Visual
C++ complains about memory leaks, as most errors are in the direction of
keeping objects too long, not in referencing a deleted object.  It is
also possible to throw the problem back on the programmer by requiring a
Destroy() method call as well as a Create() method.  In WPY this is done
only when it makes sense anyway.  The implication is that the Python
objects may exist, but that MFC will delete objects only when Destroy()
is called.</P><P>Another problem concerns the C++ object pointers.  It
is sometimes necessary to test for what kind of pointer we have been
given from Python so that the proper C++ method can be called.  In
Visual C++ this is possible with the IsKindOf() method.  Use of this
method should not really be necessary in an object oriented system, so
this is a little worrisome.  Also, pointers are stored in the
dictionaries as generic CObject pointers, and they are cast to the
proper type when used.  Casting pointers is always objectionable, but I
have found no easy solution.  Pointers can be checked for proper type
with the IsKindOf method, or by scrutinizing the Python object for known
attributes of that type.  Fortunately the Python "self" (C++ "this")
pointer is correct, since its value is assigned through the inheritance
mechanism, so the concern is only with method arguments.</P><H2>Summary</H2><P
>This scheme for extending C++ MFC in Python is very effective and
convenient in WPY.  In WPY, MFC method calls are usually not just
mechanical calls of plain MFC methods.  They have additional logic to
alter the arguments and the return values to a more Python-like form.
And they have additional Python logic to support the Tk GUI system which
has no access to MFC.  I also like having the complete class hierarchy
and method list available and visible in Python.  The scheme tends to
result in a maximum of Python code and a minimum of C, my favorite
balance.  It is also a simple scheme as such things go, and I find I can
understand it even at 1 AM.  But because of the special nature of WPY I
do not know if it is the best scheme for any C++ class library.  If you
give it a try, I would appreciate a note on how it works for you.</P><P>James
