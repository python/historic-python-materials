<BODY><H1>Status of WPY, a portable GUI module for Python</H1><STRONG>Presented
at the December 1995 Python workshop by <A HREF="mailto:jim@interet.com">
James C. Ahlstrom</A></STRONG><H2>What is WPY?</H2><P>Wpy is a Python
module which provides a class library, a message system and other tools
for writing portable graphical user interface (GUI) code.  You import
"wpy.py" into your Python program and use it to write GUI code which
will run unchanged on Unix/X using Tk, or on Microsoft Windows 3.1 and
NT.  Python is ideally suited to GUI development since it is a fast
object-oriented scripting language with advanced data types such as
lists and dictionaries.  Code written with WPY runs with native look and
feel on the supported platforms.  WPY is free software published with
the same licensing restrictions as Python itself (hardly any).  It comes
with 2000 lines of documentation and seven small demo programs.</P><P>Development
of WPY started a year ago,  and a <A HREF="http://www.python.org/workshops/1995-05/ahlstrom.html"
>paper presented at the May 1995  Python workshop</A> described the WPY
design objectives.  Since that time progress has been made and lessons
learned.  Currently there is a strong WPY port to Windows NT and to
Unix/Tk.  The NT port also runs well on Windows 95, and will run on
Windows 3.1 and 3.11 using Microsoft's win32s software.  Unfortunately,
the win32s system is slow, especially on the small memory systems which
can not upgrade to Windows 95.  A special Windows 3.1 port is needed.
The NT port also runs on OS/2 using a prior version of win32s and OS/2's
ability to run Windows programs, but the Windows 3.1 port will be a more
satisfactory solution for OS/2 also.  The Unix port runs on a stock
build of Python with Tk version 4.0 and the tkintermodule.c module
included with the Python distribution.  All extra WPY support on Unix is
supplied in Python in the wpy_tk.py module.</P><P>Native ports to other
platforms have not been attempted.  For the Mac, Microsoft publishes a
tool to enable MFC code to be compiled for the Mac, and this should
result in an immediate port, assuming a volunteer who owns the tool can
be found.  A native OS/2 port would be nice, but no volunteers have
emerged.</P><P>  WPY is not a port of something else, it is new code. 
It is a small simple system with a minimum of layers and a small
footprint.  On Unix/Tk/X, WPY code consists of the Python modules wpy.py
(2247 lines, 76K bytes), wpy_tk.py (1527 lines, 53K bytes) and wpycon.py
(607 lines, 14K bytes), plus wpy_tk.def (small).  Currently no C code is
used to support WPY on Unix.  A stock linux binary of Python with Tk is
about 900K bytes.  On NT, WPY consists of wpy.py, wpycon.py and 12 C++
modules totalling 6412 lines.  Python.exe for NT is 312 K bytes
consisting of about 230 Kb of stock Python and 82Kb of WPY C++ support,
a truly tiny footprint.</P><H2>Programming Model</H2><P>The WPY
programming model is based on Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) with as
few changes as possible.  A program written for WPY is completely
analogous to the equivalent program written in C++, and looks like C++
transliterated into Python.  The exceptions (discussed below) are in the
direction of a higher level model.  More specifically, the following are
the most important elements of any GUI programming model:</P><UL>
<LI>The class hierarchy is exactly that of MFC, and method names are
mostly identical.  There are a few exceptions which arise when MFC uses
flag bits to change the meaning of a class.  For example, MFC has only
one button class with a flag to distinguish between push buttons, check
buttons and radio buttons.  These are three separate classes in WPY. 
Also, since MFC lacks geometry management, this is supplied using Python
multiple inheritance.</LI>
<LI>The GUI model is Document/View (not widget nor window based), just
as in MFC.  That means that the programmer concentrates on opening files
and providing a method for drawing a document, while the system creates
whatever windows are required.  Usually the programmer will never
directly create a window, but merely specify the type of View should one
be required.</LI>
<LI>Both WPY and MFC provide a large number of standard menu items,
complete with status window text and default handlers.  Use of standard
menu items is required for Windows programs, and makes programming
easier in Unix.</LI>
<LI>WPY uses the MFC message handling procedures.  Basically, there are
three kinds of messages which are sent to GUI objects which may be able
to handle them.  Messages of type "Window" such as Create Window, Resize
Window, Destroy Window are sent to the affected window object.  "User
interaction" messages such as key press and mouse events are sent to the
active view.  That is, the user interacts with the document through the
view of the document.  "Command messages" such as menu selection events
and button presses are aggressively routed.  That means that when a
command event happens, a whole series of GUI objects are inspected to
see if they have a message handler ( a method for the button press, menu
item, etc.) available.  If they do, that method is called, otherwise the
search continues for a suitable handler.  For all messages, there is no
requirement that a handler exist, and there is no need to "bind", "hook"
or otherwise register to get a message.  This is standard MFC but very
different from Tk.  However, WPY only supports a small fraction of the
message blizzard which MFC and Win32 produce.  Only very elementary
messages are supported, those which are generated by most any GUI, and
are easily available on both MFC and Tk.</LI>
<LI>In WPY, a program consists mostly of class definitions which define
message handling methods.  The whole program mostly just waits for the
user to do something so it can react to it.  This is common to most
(all?) GUI's.  A WPY program generally will have a CWinApp class
(representing the whole application) with an InitInstance() method.  WPY
will call this method at the start of the application, and the user is
expected to create a main window, choose the single or multiple document
interface <A HREF="#sdimdi">(see below)</A>, and set up menus and
status bars at that time.  This is standard MFC.  It is also possible to
just run simple Python scripts, and a Python interactive window program
is available.</LI></UL><P>There are a few differences between WPY and
MFC.  The most drastic one concerns drawing to a view.  In Tk, drawn
objects (like text, lines, rectangles, etc.) are placed in a "canvas" (a
view) and are assigned a number to identify them.  They can be moved,
erased, etc.  In MFC, the user must draw with a drawing tool
(DrawText(), LineTo(), etc.) into a "device context" associated with the
view.  The device context could also be associated with a printer, and
this method provides device independent drawing.  But in MFC objects do
not retain their identity, they are just ink.  To erase one, you would
mark the area as invalid, and the MFC system would eventually call the
user's OnDraw() method.  The OnDraw() method must be provided by the
programmer, and it must draw the document to the view.  It is possible
to write an OnDraw() method which draws the whole view every time it is
called, but in practice MFC requires an OnDraw() which will draw only
the area to be updated.  This must be done to achieve acceptable
scrolling speed and a quick re-draw if another window is moved out of
the way of the view (an "expose" event in Tk/X).  It is harder to write
this more sophisticated OnDraw() method.  Also, it is often more natural
to think of the drawn objects as, well, objects.  For example, in an
html document, anchor text is a text object in a different color which
can react to a mouse press.  So the anchor text should be an object.</P><P>
In the end, conformity with the Python language was judged more
important than conformity with MFC.  Python is too high level a language
to pester the programmer with complex OnDraw() methods and expose events
just to support decent scrolling.  So the WPY drawing model more closely
resembles Tk than MFC, although the MFC semantics are preserved. 
Specifically, the user must write an OnDraw() method which draws the
whole view, just as in standard MFC.  But the WPY system (on NT) will
attempt to refresh the screen from its own record of the drawn objects,
and will seldom call the users OnDraw() method.  Also, the drawing tools
return class instances which represent the objects being drawn, and WPY
provides methods to re-draw the objects (for example, with changed
text), and to find the object under a mouse click.  These operations are
supported directly by Tk, and on NT support comes from C++ code (for
speed).</P><H2>Current Features</H2><P>WPY is currently at version
0.32, and is being actively developed.  It is at the "incomplete but
useful" stage.  The available classes are:</P>

><A NAME="geometry">Geometry Management</A></H2><P>Consider a dialog
box with a text message and two buttons, Yes and No.  Geometry
management means the way a GUI produces a layout for that dialog, that
is, how you must specify the size and position of the controls. 
Geometry should be device independent so that the layout is valid for
any screen resolution.  Good geometry management makes using a GUI much
easier because a considerable amount of programmer time is devoted to
layout.</P><P>In Windows, layout is done with a resource editor which
would display a picture of the dialog box and allow the user to move
controls to the desired position.  The resultant positions are expressed
relative to a character size on the screen and are recorded in resource
files.  These resource files are incorporated into the program as binary
data.  Use of resource files is not possible within WPY due to its
dynamic nature.  MFC itself lacks any geometry management.  A control is
created with the C++ "new" operator, and then the Create method is
called for the new control.  The size and position of the control must
be specified in pixels in the Create method.  MFC does have messages
which can be used to perform layout.  When a window is created the
OnCreate() method of the window is called followed by the OnSize()
method.  The size of the window is available when OnSize() is called. 
If the user resizes the window, another OnSize() message is generated. 
Positions of controls can be set within OnSize() and will be
recalculated when required.  For dialogs (the usual container of
controls) only an OnInitDialog() message exists since dialogs can not be
resized by the user.</P><P>Tk has two geometry managers available, the
placer and the packer.  The placer fixes the position of the control
either in pixels or as a decimal relative to its window.  That is,
either as the point (40, 80) in pixels, or as (0.10, 0.20) where the
decimal locations are relative to  the window the control is in.  The
packer is more sophisticated.  The packer locates controls around the
edges of the window using up the available space as it goes along, and
then sizes the window to be the right size to contain the controls.  It
is possible to add a border to controls to space them out from the edge.
 The ability to size the container window is especially valuable, since
this size normally depends on its contents.  But I personally find the
packer awkward to use since controls are seldom really wanted at the
edge of windows.  Others find it quite convenient.  In Tk, geometry is
an attribute of the control, and controls have a border, an edge to be
packed at, and a packing order.  The Tk system maintains the correct
location itself based on these attributes, and there is no need for an
OnSize() message.</P><P>In WPY, controls have a two step creation
process as in MFC.  The object is first constructed from its class and
then its Create() method is called.  In WPY, the control has a default
size in pixels when it is constructed even though the object does not
exist in the GUI until it is created with Create().  This size is used
to perform layout in the OnSize() method of the window or the
OnInitDialog() message of the dialog.  There a number of utility methods
available which resemble the Tk placer, and which enable the programmer
to specify positions in pixels, or in decimals relative to any other
window or control.  The size of a meter and of a character are available
in pixels so that device independent layout is possible.  To layout the
above dialog example, create the following as a function within the
dialog's OnInitDialog() method.  First construct the message text as a
static control.  An aspect ratio can be specified for multi-line
messages.  Then construct the two buttons with their text.  Call the
utility WpyMakeEqualSize() for the two buttons to set their size to the
largest one.  Set the width of the dialog to 1.2 times the width of the
text, and the height to 1.2 times the text height plus 3 times the
button height.  Then call either WpyPlace or WpyMakeEqualSpaceX to place
the button centers at 0.333 and 0.667 within the dialog and 1.5 button
heights up.  Finally call Create() for each control.</P><P>In WPY,
geometry is not an attribute of the control as in Tk, nor does it lack
geometry management as in MFC.  Geometry management is a function to be
executed in response to a request by the system.  The controls have a
size and location attribute, but this only affects the control when it
is created or when its Move() method is called.  So geometry is set in a
function created by the programmer making use of the known sizes of the
controls before they are created.  I personally find it easy to write
these functions, but I have a mathematical background.  Others may find
it awkward.  My feeling is that better geometry management is desirable,
and that the current system is too low level.  The good news is that all
OS GUI interfaces are done, and a new geometry manager can be written
all in Python independent of any particular platform.  Or the fabled
Visual Python layout tool could be written in WPY to perform visual
layout as in Windows.</P><H2>Design Issues</H2><P>Normal MFC programs
rely on "resources" for their menus, icons, window header text, and for
other static text items.  Resources are compiled-in static data, and so
are incompatible with WPY which must interpret Python programs on the
fly.  Getting rid of all of MFC's dependencies on resources was the most
difficult WPY design issue.  Luckily there seems to be a progression
towards less reliance on resources in recent MFC releases.  See also
another <A HREF="http://www.python.org/workshops/">paper</A> presented
at this workshop on the method used by WPY to extend the MFC C++ classes
in Python.</P><P>All significant technical issues now seem to be
solved, and the "only" remaining problem is how to support the same GUI
model on different platforms.  To implement a typical new WPY feature,
it is first necessary to figure out how to implement it on MFC.  It is
easiest to do that in Python after first making a few MFC calls
available to Python in a C-language interface module in the usual way. 
The reason is that it is faster to program in Python, and programming in
MFC is (at least for me) often an experimental science.  There always
seems to be multiple ways to do something, only one of which makes sense
and works.  After some experimentation, an understanding of how MFC
"feels" about a feature is attained.  Then the identical feature is
written in Tk in Python scripts.  Even though the Tk version will
require more support because the Python feature will be phrased in MFC
terms, the time required to implement an MFC feature in Tk is about the
same as in MFC because Tk is simpler and yet quite powerful.  After an
understanding of Tk is acquired, it is time to design a sensible WPY
feature which is simple, high level, elegant and easily implemented in
both MFC and Tk.  The implementation is split among the files wpy.py and
wpy_tk.py, and some is in C++ for MFC.  Because of Python's excellent C
interfaces, the mix of C and Python is optimized for simplicity while
keeping in mind that wpy.py is common to all platforms.  If problems
develop due to incompatible models, the abstraction level is raised and
details are omitted in favor of simplicity.  Finally a new WPY feature
is available and documented, and a simple port to two platforms is
available.</P><P>A typical problem would be <A NAME="sdimdi">Microsoft's
Multi Document Interface</A> or MDI.  Their Single Document Interface
(SDI) just means that there is only one window for the app, and that is
not a problem.  But MDI appears as a main window with multiple small
windows clipped to be contained within it.  Each small window has a
menu, but its menu is displayed on the main window when the small window
is active.  If there are no small windows, a default main menu is
displayed.  There are also menu commands to rearrange the order of small
windows.  The basic problem here isn't technical, it is that the look of
MDI seems to drive Unix people crazy, and they hate it.  They are used
to just plain one window, or just plain several windows when required. 
But access to MDI is required for Windows people.  So if a programmer
writes an MDI Python WPY app, how does it look on Unix?  I have
published a first and second try, but I am still looking for a third. 
Try demo05.py on Unix and see.</P><P>Generally I find MFC to be quite
complicated, large, full of features, generally high level in window
creation, and yet surprisingly low level in other areas.  For example,
classes generally have dozens of non-orthogonal methods, plus many other
behaviors available from dozens more flag bits, yet MFC expects the
programmer to worry about an excessive amount of low level detail.  For
example, MFC buttons do not provide their own checking nor do menu
buttons.  The search through all the MFC features looking for the right
way to do something is often a long one.</P><P>On the other hand, Tk is
a smaller, tighter, more sensible package with a better balance of size
versus power.  But it is consistently low or medium level in
abstraction.  For example, there is no concept of "window" nor how to
create one.  Instead you just make anything you want out of the basic
widgets, and even then the anonymous X window manager will do something
unknown with it anyway.  This follows the traditional X-Windows approach
of being vendor neutral and allowing the programmer to put the scroll
bar on the left if he wants.  But there is no way to enforce any user
interface requirements.  Still, Tk is an admirable job and it is easy to
like it for Unix programming.  Mr. Osterhout is working on a Windows
version of Tk which will support the native look and feel of Windows,
but I am on record as being skeptical that that is possible without a
major change in Tk.</P><P>In summary, WPY keeps the good features of
MFC and follows it closely enough to make it easy to learn, yet still
looks natural in Python, protects the programmer from drudgery and
presents a high level model.  At least that has been the intent.</P><P>James
