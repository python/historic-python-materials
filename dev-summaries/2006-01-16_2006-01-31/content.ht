Google summer internships
-------------------------

Google is looking to fill an unprecedented number of `student intern
positions`_ this (US) summer, at several US locations (Mountain View,
Santa Monica, Kirkland (Wash.), and New York).  The perks are
incredible, and Google is not just looking for software development
interns - there are also product management positions, and UI design
and usability analyst positions.

Possible Summer of PyPy
-----------------------

Armin Rigo announced the possibility of a "Summer of PyPy", which
would follow the style of Google's "Summer of Code" in funding
students to work on various aspects of PyPy.  The possibility has not
been confirmed yet, but we'll let you know when there's more info.

---------------------------------------
Integers and strings in different bases
---------------------------------------

Alex Martelli requested the inverse of ``int(<string>, <base>)`` that
would convert an int into a string with digits in the appropriate
base. There was a lot of discussion of exactly where such
functionality should go. Among the suggested locations were:

* The str constructor, e.g. ``str(<number>, <base>)``
* A str classmethod, e.g. ``str.from_int(<number>, <base>)``
* An encoding method, e.g. ``str(<number>).encode("base<base>")``
* A method on ints, e.g. ``<number>.to_base(<base>)``
* A format code, e.g. ``"%<base>b" % <number>``
* A builtin function, e.g. ``base(<number>, <base>)``
* A function in the math module, e.g. ``math.base(<number>, <base>)``

People seemed generally to like the builtin function or math module
function options, though there was some debate as to the best name for
the function.  Guido suggested letting the proposal sit for a week or
two to see if anyone could come up with a better name or suggest a
better location for the function.  (However, he seemed generally in
favor of the proposal, suggesting that hex() and oct() should be
deprecated and removed in a future version of Python.)  No decisions
had been made at the time this summary was written.

PEP 355: Path - Object oriented filesystem paths
------------------------------------------------

Björn Lindqvist resuscitated the idea of incorporating a Path class
based on Jason Ordenorff's path module to the standard library by
creating `PEP 355`_.  There was some general discussion (and
corresponding PEP changes), with much discussion centred on the use of
"/" as a join-with-separator operator, which was eventually dropped
from the PEP.

More discussion considered whether Path should subclass string or not.
Subclassing string provides the advantage that Paths can be used in
the majority of places where strings are currently used, without
modification.  However, there are many methods of strings that do not
seem appropriate for Path objects.  Jason Orendorff would prefer for
Paths to not subclass strings, and a new format specifier (e.g. for
PyArg_ParseTuple()) be created for use with Paths.

There was general agreement that the utility of the module would be
highest when Path objects could be seamlessly used where string paths
were previous used.  The debate centred on whether subclassing string
was the best way to do this or not.  Path objects clearly are not
string objects (e.g. __iter__ and join() are nonsensical with paths).
Changing the C API so that Paths are accepted where necessary was the
suggested solution, although the PEP (at the time of writing the
summary) still subclasses Path from string.

Changing the methods from the names used by the os module and Jason's
module to ones that conform to PEP 8 was recommended.  Jason explained
that the reason that there is so much cruft in his path module is that
the design is heavily skewed toward people already familiar with the
existing standard library equivalents.  He feels that a standard
library Path class should have different design goals: less
redundancy, fewer methods, and PEP 8 compliant names.

Including ctypes in the stdlib
------------------------------

The inclusion of ctypes in the standard library hit a snag: although
Guido pronounced that including it (with a strongly worded wording in
the documentation) was fine, ctypes includes libffi, which is built
with GPL'd tools, which is causes licensing issues.  A lot of the
typical legal-advice-from-everyone-but-lawyers discussion took place,
but essentially what is required is a way to calculate the information
necessary to build libffi without the GPL'd tools.  Hye-Shik Chang did
some work on this, and is working on integrating this into the ctypes
repository, so ctypes may still may it into the standard library.

Improving the documentation process
-----------------------------------

Georg Brandl pointed out the new `documentation effort`_ by Fredrik
Lundh which uses a mix of HTML and PythonDoc-style markup and allows
convenient single-method links like
http://effbot.org/lib/os.path.join. Georg Brandl played around a bit
with the `CSS styling`_, however the main focus of Fredrik's effort
was to lower the threshold for user contributions. Along these lines,
he was working on an alternate content management system for editing
the Python documentation. He currently has a prototype_ available that
mirrors some of the content on python.org, though whether or not this
backend will be incorporated into python.org is as yet undecided.

Updating ConfigParser
---------------------

The discussion about possible ConfigParser improvements continued,
with the typical failure to make any decisions.

As always, the options include small modifications to the existing
ConfigParser (e.g. allowing preservation of comments, order, and
whitespace), re-writing ConfigParser (perhaps based on existing
third-party versions), or providing a more sophisticated configuration
file module (either leaving ConfigParser as-is, or rewriting it to use
the new module).

---------------------------------------
Introducing a basenumber abstract class
---------------------------------------

Alex Martelli proposed introducing a class, basenumber, along the
lines of the basestring class. The intention was to make it easier to
check whether or not something is a number. However, if inheriting
from basenumber was required for all new number-like objects, then the
duck-typing approach of simply implementing the appropriate interface
would no longer work. Also, since inheriting from multiple builtin
types is disallowed, a str subclass that needs to act like a number
(e.g. a symbolic type) would no longer be able to do so since it could
not also inherit from basenumber.

Guido suggested an __index__ method that would identify a type as
convertible into an integer, though without the loss of precision
allowed by __int__. More on this suggestion in the next summary.

-----------------------------------
New Python website: beta.python.org
-----------------------------------

Skip Montanaro pointed out that Tim Parkin is heading up a `new
effort`_ to redesign the python.org site. The system is based on
content formatted primarily in ReST_ for easy editing, though to fully
render the pages a number of other tools are required. Tim hopes to
get these all wrapped up in setuptools_ and eggs_ so that anyone can
also see the fully rendered pages.

Also on the topic of webpage redesign, Steve Holden looked into
changing the sourceforge "Download Python" link to point to the right
place: http://www.python.org/download/.  This link, however, cannot be
directly modified, so Martin v. Löwis put a small warning above it.

Readline on OS X 10.4
---------------------

Thomas Heller has a problem building readline on OS X 10.4.  This is a
known issue, the result of Apple shipping libedit symlinked to
readline rather than readline itself.  You need to get a third party
copy of readline - Bob Ippolito made a _readline egg`_.
Alternatively, if LDFLAGS AND CPPFLAGS are set appropriately for
/opt/local/lib and opt/local/include, and the DarwinPorts copy of
readline is installed, then it will be found by setup.py.

Concerns about linking with readline (which is released under the GPL)
were raised, that explicitly requiring or checking for readline could
violate the licence.  A suggestion was made that Python 3000 could
stop using readline and use an alternative instead.

Yielding from a sub-generator
-----------------------------

Before PEP 342, there wasn't a big need for a shortcut to pass control
to a "sub-generator" because the following for-loop works well enough::

     def main_generator():
         ...
         for value in sub_generator():
             yield value

but now that yield can return a value, that value might have to be
passed into sub_generator(), not to mention exceptions. Guido felt
that a syntactic solution is needed, if the problem is important
enough to be solved; a suggestion was "yield from sub_generator()".

----------------------------------------
Using the Win32 API for stat/fstat/wstat
----------------------------------------

Martin v. Löwis wanted to switch the code for stat/fstat/wstat from
using msvcrt to the Win32 API. However, currently, when WindowsError
is raised, the errno attribute must be interpreted as a Win32 error
instead of as an errno.h error as in its superclass, OSError. The
Win32 API provides different error codes, so using these for the errno
attribute could cause some code breakage.  The options seemed to be
either to break WindowsError and use the new Win32 API error codes, or
to introduce a new windows_error attribute to hold the additional
information.  No decision had been made at the time this summary was
written.

---------------------------
Making timeit easier to use
---------------------------

Connelly Barnes was concerned that the default behavior of the timeit
module was not very useful.  Since timing a function seems like the
most common use of timeit, it should be a simple operation, not a
method call with a string describing how to import the function and
then another string describing how to call it.  Also, the default
behavior of 1 million iterations is not useful for any code that
cannot be repeated that many times.  Instead, the number of iterations
should be calibrated as it is in the command-line version. Nick
Coghlan provided an implementation for these improvements, but it was
unclear whether or not those changes would be applied to the module.

Removing deprecated modules
---------------------------

The regex, regsub and timing modules have been obsolete since Python
2.0, but are still importable in Python 2.4 (regex and regsub both
generate a deprecation warning).  Skip Montanaro asked when these
would be removed, and Guido said that they should be as soon as
possible.

How to Read the Summaries
-------------------------

This summary is written using reStructuredText_. Any unfamiliar
punctuation is probably markup for reST_ (otherwise it is probably
regular expression syntax or a typo :); you can safely ignore it.  We
do suggest learning reST, though; it's simple and is accepted for
`PEP markup`_ and can be turned into many different formats like HTML
and LaTeX.  Unfortunately, even though reST is standardized, the
wonders of programs that like to reformat text do not allow us to
guarantee you will be able to run the text version of this summary
through Docutils_ as-is unless it is from the `original text file`_.
